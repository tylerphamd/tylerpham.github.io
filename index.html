<p>I am a PhD candidate looking for internship and full-time work opportunities in statistics, data analytics, and quantitative research, including academic and industry opportunities. I am currently a statistical consultant for the Center for Statistical Training and Consulting (CSTAT) at Michigan State University. Want to chat about research, consulting work, graduate school, and more? Reach out to me at phamduy@msu.edu. I look forward to connecting with you.

<p> My primary research interest is in uncovering cognitive processes behind how we use message exchange in mediated interpersonal communication to build and maintain relationships. I use various methods in my research, including online and lab experiments, machine learning and natural language processing. Currently, I am building my coding skills in R and Python to serve my research and statistical consulting work.
